          <p class="testimonialText">"Honorability, integrity, and quality are the most valued traits we can ask for in the construction contractors we employ. Dave and Tina fit these to the tee! Dave worked on projects for us in the 15 years prior to Entheos. Since he and Tina joined forces, together they continued to provide construction outcomes over and above what we expect. Kudos to Tina, Dave and Entheos!"</p>

          <p class="testimonialText">"I can't say enough good things about Dave, of Entheos Builders, who did an exceptional job building a porch on our home. Dave demonstrated a keen understanding of our vision and translated that into reality with excellent communication every step of the way, skilled craftmanship and a stress-free process. The finished result exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend Entheos Builders."</p>

          <p class="customerName">Nir Pearlson AIA, Principal</p>
          <p class="testimonialText">"I have been working with Dave Veldhuizen since 2011, and he is one of the best builders I know. Dave is an incredibly skilled craftsman, a supportive and respectful team-player, an excellent leader, and a perfectionist. He cares deeply about his product, as well as his clients, his subcontractors, his workers, and the designers, engineers, and all who collaborate with him - resulting in loyal workers and subcontractors. Dave is an avid learner, and has deep expertise in timber-framing, passive house construction, and other high-performance building methodologies. Dave provides detailed cost estimating when needed during the design process, and conducts business in full fairness and full transparency.

            For me as an architect, working with Dave on a project is a real pleasure: he studies and understands the architect's design intent and the engineer's logic; he provides thoughtful and innovative input regarding design and constructability; he is personable and great fun to hang out with and discuss life matters, not just work; and he is a 'literalist' - impeccably executing the design into beautiful forms, spaces, and details. Dave is your preferred builder!"</p>
