          <p class="discription">Dave Veldhuizen has over 30 years experience successfully managing and executing
            residential construction projects of all sizes. Dave was the founder and owner of Six Degrees Construction
            in Eugene, Oregon which became the premier award winning residential builder for that part of Oregon. Six
            Degrees Construction was regionally and nationally recognized for their emphasis on craftsmanship, integrity
            and adapting cutting edge building science in the service of deep energy efficiencies. Dave enjoys mountain
            biking, skate skiing, golf, running and meditation when not on the jobsite.</p>

          <p class="discription">Tina Cooley understands that passion for building is supported by creativity, problem
            solving and communication. Tina loves working with clients on the big and small details of each project. 
            She is patient, curious and detail oriented. Tina loves finding out what makes people excited about their
            life, whether it is their new home, their grandkids, or the book they are reading.  When she is not covered
            in sawdust she can be found cycling roads and trails around Fort Collins with friends, skate skiing along
            snowy trails with Dave, cooking large meals for their family, or her latest amusement - swinging golf clubs.
